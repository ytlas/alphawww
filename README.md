Just a personal project that I plan to put much effort in.
It will eventually be uploaded and hosted on http://ytlas.com/
The focus will be:
 - Responsive design with Bootstrap
 - User friendly design (pretty-ish)
 - Asynchronous code
 - Structured and organized code (Mainly fixing the broken structure from the past AngularJS controllers from the previous website)
